he error message you're seeing:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
failed to query server version: call to url failed: none of the trustmanagers trust this certificate chain
‚Ä¶means that the SonarQube Maven scanner is unable to establish a secure HTTPS connection to the SonarQube server because it doesn't trust the server's SSL certificate.

Root Cause
Java (and therefore Maven) relies on a truststore (typically cacerts) to validate SSL certificates. If the SonarQube server uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate not trusted by default Java truststore, you'll get this error.

Solution Options
‚úÖ Option 1: Import the certificate into Java truststore
Export the SSL certificate used by your SonarQube server:

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect <your-sonarqube-host>:443 -showcerts
Copy the certificate (everything from -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- to -----END CERTIFICATE-----) into a file, e.g., sonarqube.crt.

Import it into your Java truststore:

bash
Copy
Edit
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -alias sonarqube -file sonarqube.crt
Verify the certificate is imported:

bash
Copy
Edit
keytool -list -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | grep sonarqube
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you're using the Java version that Maven uses, or you'll need to specify the JAVA_HOME accordingly.

‚úÖ Option 2: Use a custom truststore
If you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to modify the global cacerts file, you can pass a custom truststore in your Maven command:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn sonar:sonar \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/your/truststore \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword
‚úÖ Option 3: Use HTTP instead of HTTPS (Not recommended for production)
If this is a dev/test environment and you're not dealing with sensitive data, you could reconfigure SonarQube to serve over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This avoids certificate issues entirely ‚Äî but also bypasses encryption.

Bonus Tip: Verify SonarQube URL
Make sure the sonar.host.url is set correctly in your pom.xml or settings.xml, or via command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
-Dsonar.host.url=https://your-sonarqube-server
Let me know if you need help exporting the cert or adjusting the truststore.

Failed to execute goal org.sonar.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar-maven-plugin:5.1.0.4751:sonar (default-cli) on project: The scanner bootstrapping has failed!
‚Ä¶is a generic failure from the Sonar Maven plugin during its initialization ("bootstrapping"). The real cause is usually buried earlier in the logs. Based on your earlier message:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
none of the trustmanagers trust this certificate chain
That‚Äôs likely the underlying cause: an SSL handshake failure due to untrusted certificates.

üîç How to Investigate Further
Run the Maven command again with debug output enabled to get full details:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn sonar:sonar -X
This will show a full stack trace and pinpoint exactly why bootstrapping fails.

üîß Most Common Fix (Recap)
Since the issue appears to stem from an untrusted SSL certificate on the SonarQube server:

Export the server certificate (using openssl):

bash
Copy
Edit
openssl s_client -connect <your-sonarqube-server>:443 -showcerts
Save the certificate to a file like sonarqube.crt.

Import it into your Java truststore:

bash
Copy
Edit
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -alias sonarqube -file sonarqube.crt
(Replace $JAVA_HOME with the Java version Maven uses.)

Verify the import:

bash
Copy
Edit
keytool -list -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | grep sonarqube
‚úÖ Temporary Workaround
If you‚Äôre just testing and want to ignore certificate checks (not recommended for production), add this to your Maven command:

bash
Copy
Edit
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/truststore \
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit
Or switch to HTTP in sonar.host.url (if enabled on your server):

bash
Copy
Edit
-Dsonar.host.url=http://your-sonarqube-host
If you paste the output of mvn sonar:sonar -X, I can analyze the exact root cause for you.
