-----------------------

Quoted heredoc delimiter with <<- 'EOF':

The - allows for indentation stripping, but this only works when the delimiter is unquoted.

Quoting 'EOF' disables variable and command substitution, which might not be what you want.

Quoting also disables the effect of -, so the closing EOF must not be indented at all.


-----
The EOF closing tag must be on its own line with no trailing whitespace or indentation (since you're using a quoted heredoc)

cat << 'EOF' > /etc/profile.d/nvm_home.sh
export NVM_DIR="/opt/nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
EOF
